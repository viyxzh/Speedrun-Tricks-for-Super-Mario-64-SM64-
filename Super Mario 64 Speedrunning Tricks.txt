Speedrunning tricks for Super Mario 64

1. Backwards Long Jump

The Backwards Long Jump, or BLJ for short, is a trick that consists of developing insanely high speeds (a.k.a Hyperspeed)
using a long jump facing backwards.
How it works:
When mario long jumps, his speed is multiplied by 1.5x, 
but its immediately capped to 48. However, Nintendo's developers
forgot to cap backwards speed, so with that, 
mario can reach negative infinity. For that, mario will 
need a place where he can jump then land immediately,
so that he can jump multiple times. These specific
places are Stairs, Slopes, Low ceilings, Moving elevators and barriers
that separates out of bounds area with in bounds area.
Inputs:
1: perform a long jump while moving in
any direction, then pressing [Z, then immediately A.]
2: Immediately after that, move reverse the direction you move,
like front to back.
3: After landing on the place, Hold [Z] then MASH [A]
while holding the joystick back.
4: Keep holding [Z] and keep mashing [A].
5: To break out of your spot (if in a low ceiling),
release [Z] and try to move somewhere.

2. Lakitu Skip
This trick consists of skipping lakitu's dialogue
on the start of the game with precise movement.
How it works:
Lakitu normally speaks to Mario at the start of the game, 
which is controlled by a large trigger area that 
spans the entire bridge, except for a tiny sliver on
each horizontal side. If Mario only steps on the
extreme edge of the bridge, Lakitu never decides
to have a chat with the player
Inputs:
There are no specific inputs for this,
although, you'l need visual cues for
that, well, its recommended to spam [Z] 
and [A] to perform long jumps.
be careful while doing this trick.
With enough practice, you'll know
how to do it without being hard.

3. Cannonless (Whomp's Fortress)
This consists of getting the star
"Blast Away The Wall" without cannons
How it works:
Normally, you use a cannon to blow yourself in
the wall beneath the rotating platform, so
you get the Power Star trapped inside there.
Although, the breakable wall was placed
uncorrectly in a vertical number of 1 unit of length;
this allows the other wall underneath the specific one
to make room so we have a ledge. Since Mario can grab
a ledge when falling, the trick falls to aim among
the underneath wall and the breakable one
to perform the ledge grab, and if the star's
hitbox lines up with mario's current relative
position hitbox, he will get the star.
Inputs:
Use the Joystick and get a precise
position and speed to line up with the ledge.

4. First-frame wallkicks
First frame wallkicks or Firsties for short, consists of
wallkicking in the wall in frame-perfect input.
How it works:
A wallkick has 2 parts: first, Mario bonks on the wall,
losing all his speed. Then, if [A] is pressed within a 
5-frame window, he performs a wallkick, automatically 
gaining 24 speed in the direction reflecting off the wall.
But if [A] is pressed on the first possible frame of the
wallkick window, Mario doesn't have time to lose all his
speed and he kicks off the wall with the same speed he
had previously.
Inputs:
1: Press [A] to jump, facing a wall.
2: Press [A] again in the first
possible frame of the 5-frame window.

tip: after the wallkick, hold [A] for 0.3
seconds to reach higher heights.

5. Bomb Clip (Bob-omb Battlefield)
This trick consists of clipping through a wall using an explosion.

How it works:
When Mario takes explosive knockback, the game forcibly moves him out of
the explosion hitbox. If Mario is positioned close enough to a wall or
corner, this displacement can push him through collision. Bomb-ombs
produce a strong knockback that is consistent and reusable, making them
ideal for clips. The angle and distance from the wall determine whether
Mario is pushed inside or through the geometry.

Inputs:
1: Get close to a Bob-omb and press [B] to hold it.
2: Jump [A] and throw it mid-air with [B] while facing
right.
3: Immediately after the throwing animation starts, move
the stick to the right.
4: This will cause Mario to get closer to the
Bob-omb while throwing.
5: While the Bob-omb dramatically gets
bigger for a third of a second, grab the
Bob-omb as fast as possible.
6: This will cause the Bob-omb to push Mario backwards
so forcibly you can clip walls, but clip specifically
the cage behind the Chain Chomp.
7: When Mario touches the wall, release it
with [B], and grab the star.

tip: While Mario grabs the Bob-omb, he can do all
sorts of unintended actions like ground pound
and double jumping.

tip 2: facing slightly away from the 
wall increases consistency.

6. Triple Jump Dive (TJD)

This trick consists of gaining extra horizontal distance by diving at the
peak of a triple jump.

How it works:
A triple jump gives Mario his highest vertical velocity. Diving near the
peak converts part of this vertical speed into forward momentum. Because
the dive preserves speed better than normal air movement, this results in
a longer and faster trajectory than a standard triple jump.

Inputs:
1: Build momentum and speed for the process.
2: Press [A] three times in the intended timing
to perform a triple jump.
3: At or near the peak of the triple jump, 
press [B] to dive.
4: Hold the stick forward to maintain direction.

Tip: diving too early kills height, 
diving too late kills distance.

7. C-Up Slide

This trick consists of sliding on steep slopes that normally make Mario
slip off.

How it works:
When the C-Up camera is active, Mario’s intended movement direction is
slightly altered. On certain slopes, this causes the game to treat Mario as
walking sideways relative to the slope, preventing him from sliding off.
This allows Mario to walk or jump on otherwise unwalkable terrain.

Inputs:
1: Press [C-Up]
2: Walk onto a slope at a slight angle.
3: Adjust the joystick carefully to avoid slipping.
4: Jump when needed to maintain position.

8. Speed Kick

This trick consists of preserving speed by kicking in the
air instead of diving.

How it works:
If Mario performs a kick shortly after touching the ground, his landing
speed is preserved and converted into forward momentum. Since kicks don't
interfer with Mario's speed, he can preserve it from kicking.

Inputs:
1: Press [A]
2: Hold the stick VERY next to Neutral (idle)
3: Press [B] then immediately move the stick
the direction Mario was going.
